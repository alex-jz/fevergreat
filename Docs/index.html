My work has involved using tools such as Nielsen, Python, Tableau, RStudio, and Qlik, and I have honed my skills in data visualization, statistical analysis, and machine learning techniques.

As a result, I have developed a highly adaptable and creative approach to challenges, and have the ability to think outside the box when it comes to designing innovative solutions.
        I am excited about the opportunity to work with the team at Apple, a company that has always been at the forefront of technology and innovation. I believe that my skills and experience would be a valuable asset to the team, and I look forward to contributing to Apple's continued success in the field of machine learning and AI.</p>
